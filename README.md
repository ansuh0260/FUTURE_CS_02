# 🛡 FUTURE_CS_02 – Incident Response & Security Alert Monitoring

This repository contains the outcome of Task 2 from my Cybersecurity Internship under **Future Interns**. In this project, I explored how real SOC (Security Operations Center) teams detect and respond to threats by analyzing simulated security logs using **Splunk**, a leading **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** tool.

---

## ✅ Task Overview

In this task, I used Splunk to:

- Monitor and analyze simulated security events from CSV log data
- Identify suspicious activity like brute-force logins and malware detection
- Classify each alert by severity (High, Medium, Low)
- Generate an *Incident Response Report* summarizing the findings, impact, and recommended remediation steps

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- 🌐 **Splunk Cloud (Free Trial)** – SIEM platform used for log analysis
- 📄 **CSV Log File** – Simulated system, authentication, and malware logs
- 🖥 **Edge Browser** – For interacting with Splunk dashboard
- 📸 **Snipping Tool** – To capture evidence screenshots

---

## 📄 Deliverables

- ✅ *Incident Response Report* 
- 📸 *Screenshots* of log investigation in Splunk
- 📊 *Alert Severity Classification Table* based on event type
- 🧠 Summary of learnings from real-world SOC simulation

---

## 🔍 Learnings

- Hands-on experience with *SIEM tools*
- Performed real-time *log analysis & event correlation*
- Understood incident lifecycle: detection → classification → response
- Practiced writing *professional incident reports* for security teams
